Lonero Operating System
=======================

|N|Solid|

Lonero OS is based off of the Lubuntu OS, and has a few adding things
such as:

1. The uncompiled source binaries of: GitPrep, SMesh, Kademlia, Beaker
   Browser, and VPNBook
2. Telegram Desktop installed
3. DuckDuckGo should be the default browser

This project is part of an aim to create an open, distributed,
censorship resistant operating system, and this is the beta of that.
