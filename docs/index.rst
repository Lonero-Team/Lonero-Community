About Us
~~~~~~~~

Lonero utilizes Cryptonote’s protocols and our HashBolt masternode
consensus, taking security, transaction speeds, and mining profits to a
new global `standard`_.

What is Lonero?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Utilizes our HashBolt masternode consensus that allows for mining on
   ASIC and Non-ASIC systems.
-  Our decentralized technology allows both staking and mining in order
   to keep the technology ahead of the market.
-  Lonero outperforms leading privacy coins by integrating HashBolt,
   higher block size, segregated witnesses, as well as a lightning
   network.
-  Prioritizes safe and secure transactions by utilizing Cryptonote’s
   ring signature protocol and our custom multi-layer encryption.

Lonero Operating System
=======================

|N|Solid1|

Lonero OS is based off of the Lubuntu OS, and has a few adding things
such as:

1. The uncompiled source binaries of: GitPrep, SMesh, Kademlia, Beaker
   Browser, and VPNBook
2. Telegram Desktop installed
3. DuckDuckGo should be the default browser

This project is part of an aim to create an open, distributed,
censorship resistant operating system, and this is the beta of that.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Support freedom and decentralization
-  Has pre-installed source codes of P2P modules
-  Already has bluetooth, and a bit-torrent transmission client (as does
   Lubuntu)
-  An operating system easy to run decentralized blockchain applications
   on
-  The same software modules used here is the same operating system for
   "ChainBoard" which is a hardware board used by startups such as Stark
   Drones Corporation
   
Install via Docker: ``docker pull gamer456148/lonero-os``

LonScript
~~~~~~~~~

-  Utilizing ANTLR Parsing
-  Allows for Multi-State Machinery
-  Truly built for Scientific Computing 
and so much more….

--------------

This project was created in order to support a new internet. One that is
more open, free, and censorship-resistant in comparison to the old
internet. An internet that eventually wouldn’t need to rely on telecom
towers, an outdated grid, or all these other “old school” forms of tech.
We believe P2P compatibility is an important part of the future of the
net. Grid Computing also plays a role in having a better means of
transferring information in a speedy, more cost-efficient and reliable
manner.

ChainBoard \| The Next Gen Wireless Dev Board
=============================================

|N|Solid|

About
~~~~~
ChainBoard is the next big thing for hardware enthusiasts, tinkerers and makers wanting to go "decentralized"

|N|Solid01|

Having worked on an Underwater WiFi project before, I have had the
experience of utilizing multiple microcontrollers in order to achieve
what I wanted. Having a bunch of pieces of hardware wired together
seemed inefficient, and I looked at what the main components I needed
were. This led me to make ChainBoard. ChainBoard is meant to be a high
end microcontroller and personal computer that has many components
needed to build complex LoRaWAN, bluetooth, wireless and sensory
projects. You essentially have what is needed for low-energy bluetooth,
mesh networking, LoRa transmission, UART-based communication modules,
and many more all into a single board. |N|Solid02| |N|Solid03|

\*Some of the items that were in the above table included the below main
components:

-  32-bit MCUs
-  915MHZ Lora Transceiver
-  928MHZ Lora+Bluetooth Module
-  Bluetooth 4.2 BLE Module
-  IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Low Energy Bluetooth Module
-  USB to UART Bridge Controller

|N|Solid04| |N|Solid05| |N|Solid06|

Not only can you use ChainBoard for the project ideas I demonstrated, but there are ways it can be utilized for much more. For example, one can create a smart plug or smart home system with ChainBoard. One can be able to have ChainBoard act as the mainframe for a small mesh network with multiple low cost bluetooth devices. One can create their own LoRaWAN transmission client. Somebody can even make a microcontroller controlled generator type system or utilize ChainBoard for an interconnected security system.


Given the capabilities of the components, and its cost, we didn't want ChainBoard to be minimal in its applicable use cases. We wanted to create something that people may start building untop of. We wanted components that can be utilized for decentralization or P2P style connectivity. This may seem like just a extravagant project board, but we envision something much bigger. However, in order to make history, we feel we need to target the hobbyists first.
