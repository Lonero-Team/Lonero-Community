About Us
~~~~~~~~

Lonero utilizes Cryptonote’s protocols and our HashBolt masternode
consensus, taking security, transaction speeds, and mining profits to a
new global `standard`_.

What is Lonero?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Utilizes our HashBolt masternode consensus that allows for mining on
   ASIC and Non-ASIC systems.
-  Our decentralized technology allows both staking and mining in order
   to keep the technology ahead of the market.
-  Lonero outperforms leading privacy coins by integrating HashBolt,
   higher block size, segregated witnesses, as well as a lightning
   network.
-  Prioritizes safe and secure transactions by utilizing Cryptonote’s
   ring signature protocol and our custom multi-layer encryption.

Lonero Operating System
=======================

|N|Solid1|

Lonero OS is based off of the Lubuntu OS, and has a few adding things
such as:

1. The uncompiled source binaries of: GitPrep, SMesh, Kademlia, Beaker
   Browser, and VPNBook
2. Telegram Desktop installed
3. DuckDuckGo should be the default browser

This project is part of an aim to create an open, distributed,
censorship resistant operating system, and this is the beta of that.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Support freedom and decentralization
-  Has pre-installed source codes of P2P modules
-  Already has bluetooth, and a bit-torrent transmission client (as does
   Lubuntu)
-  An operating system easy to run decentralized blockchain applications
   on
-  The same software modules used here is the same operating system for
   "ChainBoard" which is a hardware board used by startups such as Stark
   Drones Corporation
