Cryptonote’s protocols and our HashBolt masternode consensus, taking
security, transaction speeds, and mining profits to a new global
`standard <https://github.com/Lonero-Team/>`__. ### What is Lonero? -
Utilizes our HashBolt masternode consensus that allows for mining on
ASIC and Non-ASIC systems. - Our decentralized technology allows both
staking and mining in order to keep the technology ahead of the market.
- Lonero outperforms leading privacy coins by integrating HashBolt,
higher block size, segregated witnesses, as well as a lightning network.
- Prioritizes safe and secure transactions by utilizing Cryptonote’s
ring signature protocol and our custom multi-layer encryption. ### Seed

Lonero Operating System
=======================

|N\|Solid|

Lonero OS is based off of the Lubuntu OS, and has a few adding things
such as:

1. The uncompiled source binaries of: GitPrep, SMesh, Kademlia, Beaker
   Browser, and VPNBook
2. ::

       Telegram Desktop installed

3. ::

       DuckDuckGo should be the default browser

This project is part of an aim to create an open, distributed,
censorship resistant operating system, and this is the beta of that. ###
Features

-  Support freedom and decentralization
-  Has pre-installed source codes of P2P modules
-  Already has bluetooth, and a bit-torrent transmission client (as does
   Lubuntu)
-  An operating system easy to run decentralized blockchain applications
   on
-  The same software modules used here is the same operating system for
   "ChainBoard" which is a hardware board used by startups such as Stark
   Drones Corporation

ChainBoard \| The Next Gen Wireless Dev Board
=============================================

|N\|Solid| ### About ChainBoard is the next big thing for hardware
enthusiasts, tinkerers and makers wanting to go "decentralized"
|N\|Solid|

Having worked on an Underwater WiFi project before, I have had the
experience of utilizing multiple microcontrollers in order to achieve
what I wanted. Having a bunch of pieces of hardware wired together
seemed inefficient, and I looked at what the main components I needed
were. This led me to make ChainBoard. ChainBoard is meant to be a high
end microcontroller and personal computer that has many components
needed to build complex LoRaWAN, bluetooth, wireless and sensory
projects. You essentially have what is needed for low-energy bluetooth,
mesh networking, LoRa transmission, UART-based communication modules,
and many more all into a single board. |N\|Solid| |N\|Solid|

\*Some of the items that were in the above table included the below main
components: - 32-bit MCUs - 915MHZ Lora Transceiver - 928MHZ
Lora+Bluetooth Module - Bluetooth 4.2 BLE Module - IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Low
Energy Bluetooth Module - USB to UART Bridge Controller

Not only can you use ChainBoard for the project ideas I demonstrated,
but there are ways it can be utilized for much more. For example, one
can create a smart plug or smart home system with ChainBoard. One can be
able to have ChainBoard act as the mainframe for a small mesh network
with multiple low cost bluetooth devices. One can create their own
LoRaWAN transmission client. Somebody can even make a microcontroller
controlled generator type system or utilize ChainBoard for an
interconnected security system.

Given the capabilities of the components, and its cost, we didn't want
ChainBoard to be minimal in its applicable use cases. We wanted to
create something that people may start building untop of. We wanted
components that can be utilized for decentralization or P2P style
connectivity. This may seem like just a extravagant project board, but
we envision something much bigger. However, in order to make history, we
feel we need to target the hobbyists first. |N\|Solid|
