The **Lonero ATM Project** is a fork of `openbitcoinatm`_, but for the
concept of Lonero. Part of the reason this was made was seeing projects
like `Bitstop`_, inspired us to want to create something open source
that would make Lonero more accessible. Please keep in mind this is
intended for educational usecases and aspects only. Please keep in mind
regulatory laws, and that ATM or crypto businesses may need a `Money
Transmitter License`_. Also please keep in mind this crypto is a
utility, and this repo as well as community hardware project is
primarily intended for educational purposes. To quote `Jay Clayton`_ who
was an SEC chair, *“Cryptocurrencies are replacements for sovereign
currencies…[they] replace the yen, the dollar, the euro with bitcoin.
That type of currency is not a security"*. Us at Lonero believes the
same applies at our case. Lonero was released as open source and without
an ICO. We are actively working on many technological aspects that make
`Lonero`_ unique in hopes of mass adoption.
