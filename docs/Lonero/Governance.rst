Abstract
---------
We will present technological methodologies and perspectives related to
a modern day socioeconomic system proposal. The basis of this system
will be centered around anarcho-capitalistic concepts, decentralization,
and deontological ethical premises. This framework will mention
technologies such as the `decentralized-internet SDK`_, `UDIs`_, and
technological case studies. This is primarily a computational
engineering and blockchain-centric proposal for new methodologies that
change the way current socioeconomic structures function in society. The
case for a tax-free technologically advanced society backed by
blockchain, and the potential politech implications of decentralization
through mathematical and logical methods will also be presented. This
proposal aims to provide insight to the world of blockchain, algorithms,
ethics, politics, sociophysics, economics, and financial economic
theory.
