Abstract
~~~~~~~~~~
We will present technological methodologies and perspectives related to
a modern day socioeconomic system proposal. The basis of this system
will be centered around anarcho-capitalistic concepts, decentralization,
and deontological ethical premises. This framework will mention
technologies such as the `decentralized-internet SDK`_, `UDIs`_, and
technological case studies. This is primarily a computational
engineering and blockchain-centric proposal for new methodologies that
change the way current socioeconomic structures function in society. The
case for a tax-free technologically advanced society backed by
blockchain, and the potential politech implications of decentralization
through mathematical and logical methods will also be presented. This
proposal aims to provide insight to the world of blockchain, algorithms,
ethics, politics, sociophysics, economics, and financial economic
theory.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `Lonero`_ project integrates its own cryptocurrency, as well as a
series of open hardware and collaborative efforts, in order to create
its own framework for a decentralized pipeline of systems. `Lonero's`_
crypto `LNR`_, has a technological integration for a series of different
proofs that is compatible with ASIC and non-ASIC systems. Its mining
validation system utilizes both "Proof of Work" and "Proof of Space".
The way `Lonero's`_ systems can be integrated in place goes beyond
mining, distributed computing or shared networks. One can further apply
concepts of governance and disruptive socioeconomic models.

Purpose
------------------
`Lonero's`_ technology is centered around decentralization and
decentralized use-cases, including its very own `decentralized-internet
SDK`_. In current modern times, in regards to socioeconomic systems and
the political state of things, politech startups are looking for massive
disruptive societal models and philosophies. The current allusion of
choice in regards to a two party system or currently existing systems
out there is quite noticeable. One perspective has been to look into
the adaptation of anarcho-captitalist types systems and change through
the means of pure logic and a science. This is a huge component in
regards to something `Lonero`_ wants to work on.
