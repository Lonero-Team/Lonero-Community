About
-----

The protocols that make Lonero what it is also allow for expanding use
cases for Lonero across a variety of different sectors.

*Among those usecases includes:*

-  Crypto Mining
-  IOT and "Smart Devices"
-  Grid Computing Networks
-  Software Defined Networking
-  Parallel Computing Architectures

Crypto Mining
---------------
Current cryptocurrency mining is limited to special type of hardware.
However, Lonero is working on leveling the playing field. More details
about this is shown under the `crypto section`_ or our whitepaper.

IOT and "Smart Devices"
-----------------------
Lonero's `API`_ is extensively built to allow smart device and IOT
compatibility with its `decentralized-internet SDK`_ and pipeline.

Grid Computing Networks
-------------------------
Outside of working great with software such as `PM2`_, at the core our
decentralized internet is built with grid computing in mind. Infact, you
can build custom DAPPS with grid computing compatibility or shared
computing.

Software Defined Networking
----------------------------
Software defined networking and dynamic network centered applications or
configurations work great with Lonero's decentralized internet, or even
connecting to our blockchain. Projects utilizing SDN demos of Lonero
have even included `underwater wireless networks`_.

Parallel Computing Architectures
---------------------------------
Running and syncing data in parallel or multi-threaded processes, as
well as parallel processing implementation is a huge part of our
network's overall design.
