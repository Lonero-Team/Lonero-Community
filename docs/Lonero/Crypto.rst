Intro

Lonero is a newly emerging cryptocurrency that aims to be the future of
digital cash. The problem with current privacy coins, alt coins, and
emerging cryptocurrencies relies mainly on stability, security, and an
unknown future. We aim to fix many of these stability issues, be
extremely decentralized, and have technology that actively supports the
community. We are utilizing some of the most advanced techno- logical
protocols in order to do so. This includes our consensus protocols that
support less barriers amongst ASIC vs. Non-ASIC systems, along with the
Cryptonote foundation’s widely trusted ring signature protocols,
multiple layers of security, and a utilization of “Proof of Work” and
“Proof of Space” mining. Among the technology we are also integrating a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO, bounty programs, and a
mathematical proof that allows further decentralization. We believe that
mining rewards shouldn’t merely be limited to hardware specifications
but also to total mathematical knowledge, so we provide a fair market
game to everyone involved.

Abstract
--------
The components of what makes Lonero unique is split into four different
parts: The HashBolt Masternode consensus, the DAO integrations,
Cryptonote’s ring signature integration, and multipath layer security.
In terms of the masternode consensus, we aren’t only allowing both ASIC
and Non-ASIC systems to profitably mine our cryptocurrency. We are also
granting large server infrastructures and x86 computer systems an easier
way to mine Lonero. The DAO integration that we are doing is less of an
organization and more of an integrative, curated, and regressional
artificial intelligence. We set parameters that prevent spamming or
abusing of the system to curate within our network and provide a
non-redundant experience for our users. This allows us to be fully
private, without running into compilations in our infrastructure or
allow usage Lonero in cryptojacking or distributed bot nets.

We aim to be one of the industry’s first privacy coins that is
institutionally compliant while still allowing a libertarian like usage.
We support an open free market for our users as Lonero truly is, as
stated, the future of digital cash. The utilization of cryptonote’s ring
signatures, while allowing multi-path layer security creates higher
technological stability among the transactional usage of our
cryptocurrency. Over time, we aim to be secure enough where financial
institutions and FinCEN regulated entities would allow an integration of
our system amongst theirs.

Our masternode consensus known as HashBolt allows for an extremely
decentralized crypto. It wouldn’t just break traditional hardware mining
barriers, but components such as difficulty targets don’t solely
determine technological value. Some mathematical components of our
crypto can also be solved by building recursive functions for analyzing
polynomial time or integrating merkle tree proofs for certain
transactions. The fact that we utilize the ability for segregated
witnesses and the algorithmic capabilities of what we are creating,
allows for easy scalability of the network over time.
