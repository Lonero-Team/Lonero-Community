Lonero is a newly emerging cryptocurrency that aims to be the future of
digital cash. The problem with current privacy coins, alt coins, and
emerging cryptocurrencies relies mainly on stability, security, and an
unknown future. We aim to fix many of these stability issues, be
extremely decentralized, and have technology that actively supports the
community. We are utilizing some of the most advanced techno- logical
protocols in order to do so. This includes our consensus protocols that
support less barriers amongst ASIC vs. Non-ASIC systems, along with the
Cryptonote foundation’s widely trusted ring signature protocols,
multiple layers of security, and a utilization of “Proof of Work” and
“Proof of Space” mining. Among the technology we are also integrating a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO, bounty programs, and a
mathematical proof that allows further decentralization. We believe that
mining rewards shouldn’t merely be limited to hardware specifications
but also to total mathematical knowledge, so we provide a fair market
game to everyone involved.
