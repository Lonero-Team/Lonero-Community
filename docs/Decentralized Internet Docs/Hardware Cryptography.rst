Hardware Cryptography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our `decentralized-internet SDK`_ and lots of the technologies that
`Lonero`_ works on can be utilized in hardware cryptography.

- Headless Computing Systems
- Hardware Cryptography as a Service
- Post Quantum Cryptographic Research
- Enterprise Level Cryptography Networks


Headless Computing Systems
----------------------------
Designs for headless computers and cryptographic hardware keys can be
implemented with our SDK as well as our network. Mutli-Path Layered
hardware cryptography and a flashed cryptographic hardware key network
is also feasible. We even have a key design that is built untop of the
`Lonero OS`_ through firmware connectivity.

Hardware Cryptography as a Service
------------------------------------
Another phase of service offerings can include hardware cryptography as
a service or even `Wireshark`_ integrated or network cache monitoring
solutions. This can work on both decentralized and traditional networks.

Post Quantum Cryptographic Research
------------------------------------
We are doing research in a variety of different Qubit compatible
cryptography solutions. We aim to lay foundational work for the era of
cryptography in a post-classical computing world.

Enterprise Level Cryptography Networks
---------------------------------------
Our cryptographic solutions aim to be compatible and fully scalable for
large scale enterprise systems.
